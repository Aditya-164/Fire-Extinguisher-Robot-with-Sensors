## Overview

This repository contains the code and circuit for an Automatic Fire Extinguisher Robot. The robot is designed to detect fire using three infrared sensors and respond by moving towards the fire location using a combination of motors and a servo motor to extinguish it.

## Components Used

- Arduino
- Servo Motor
- 2 Motor Driver
- 4 DC Motors
- 5V Water Pump
- 3 Infrared Sensors

## Features

- **Fire Detection:** Three infrared sensors are used to detect the presence of fire from left, right and front.
- **Movement:** The robot moves towards the fire location using the four DC motors.
- **Extinguishing Mechanism:** A servo motor is utilized to control the movement of the extinguishing mechanism, which is connected to the pipe to evenly spray out water in all directions to properly extinguish the fire.
- **Directional Control:** The robot moves left, right or front based on the direction of the detected fire using the infrared sensors.
